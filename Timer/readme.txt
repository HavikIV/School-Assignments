This Timer project is my attempt to write a program that can allow users to create time limits for all of the users accounts
in a Windows Desktop.

The program is written using visual basic.

I have been successful in being able to set individual time limits for each user and have the computer to be automatically be 
shutdown.
Haven't been able to determine on how to get the remaining time from the last session for the same day or even determine if the
user used all of their allowed time for the day.
